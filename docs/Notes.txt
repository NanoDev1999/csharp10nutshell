You can create a new template using the wizard back in Visual Studio, but using Visual Studio code we need to use the CLI.

The format can follow this 



There are many templates from here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new

https://github.com/dotnet/templating
Common project and item templates	dotnet/sdk
ASP.NET and Blazor templates	dotnet/aspnetcore
ASP.NET Single Page Application templates	dotnet/spa-templates
WPF templates	dotnet/wpf
Windows Forms templates	dotnet/winforms

We are doing a basic console app for this tutorial.




cd into src
cd src

dotnet new Console -n NameOfProgram

dotnet new Console -n MyFirstProgram
